    text: 'While in play mode, the widgets in the upper left corner of the game view
      can be used to switch camera modes, change character state, and explore different
      lighting presets.


      Click and drag anywhere else on the screen to enter
      the free camera mode, to manually rotate, pan and zoom:


      - Left mouse
      + drag: Rotate.

      - Right mouse + drag up/down: Pan.

      - Right mouse
      + drag left/right, or wheel: Zoom.


      Additional hotkeys:


      - [q,w,e,r,t]:
      Camera mode.

      - [a,s,d]: Character state.

      - [1-6]: Lighting preset.'

    text: 'It is also possible to pose the face and body of Gawain directly in the
      scene view. For the face, a facial rig from Snappers is integrated and used
      to drive a wide range of facial expressions through markers on the skin. And
      for the body, the asset also implements a control rig based on features from
      the Animation Rigging package.


      Both of these features require a bit
      more work to access and use. The steps are outlined in the next two sections:'

  - heading: Advanced controls - Face
    text: '1. Find the "SNAPPERS:Head" GameObject in the scene and select it. Make
      sure it is also visible in the inspector.


      2. Enable Gizmos in the scene
      view, and check that the "SnappersHeadRenderer" component is <i>not</i> folded
      in the inspector.


      3. A set of blue markers should now be visible on
      the face in the scene view. Each of these markers can be dragged to edit the
      pose.


      Tip #1: It can be useful to select the pose state if editing
      while in play mode. When the talk state is active, the talk animation will
      be overlaid on top.


      Tip #2: You can revert the edited pose in a couple
      of different ways. The easiest is to simply revert the "Gawain_DemoVariant"
      prefab in edit mode. Otherwise, find the "Gawain_SnappersControllers" GameObject
      and click the revert button in the inspector.'

  - heading: Advanced controls - Body
    text: '1. If in play mode, first select the pose state for the character.


      2.
      If in edit mode, open the Animation window and make sure that the Preview mode
      is enabled. This is required for the control rig to work.


      3. Find the
      "Gawain_DemoVariant" GameObject in the scene and select it. Make sure it is
      also visible in the inspector.


      4. Enable the "Rig Builder" component,
      and enable Gizmos in the scene view. A set of handles should now appear in
      the scene view for posing the body.
